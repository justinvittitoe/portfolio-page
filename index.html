                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        I am a current student in the University of Denever Coding Bootcamp. I recently graduated from California Polytechnic Univeristy San Luis Obispo with a Financial Management BS. 
                        After graduating I moved out to sunny Colorado Springs to start as an operations specialist designing processes and finding new techniques to automate manotonous tasks. 
                        This is what sparked my interest in studying computer science and learning how a computer can help automate these tasks. I am looking to expand my knowledge in computer science by connecting with professionals in 
                        all feilds of software development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On top of my motivation to learn everything there is in this feild, I also have a deep passion for the ocean and travel. I grew up in San Diego surfing since I could remember.
                        This passion has never wavered and I still hope to travel around the world surifng the worlds best surf breaks. As I am know working in Colorado, where there is no large body of water I have substituted this passion with
                        snowboarding. If you have made it this far please connect with me and lets chat on the moutain!
